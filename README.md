Introduction
According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute:

Heart disease is a catch-all phrase for a variety of conditions that affect the heartâ€™s structure and function. Coronary heart disease is a type of heart disease that develops when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Also, according to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally (source: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)).

In this notebook we try to learn enough information of this topic to understand the Heart Disease UCI dataset and build simple models to predict whether a patient has a disease or not based on features like the heart rate during exercise or the cholesterol levels in the blood.
